				<h1 id = "filmDescription"> in 1999, when the film came out, it entered a different queer and political landscape. now, the film is seen as a cult classic to queer communities. it stars natasha lyonne, as the all-american cheerleader as she's sent to a conversion camp by her parents in fear that she's a lesbian. this film follows a tale of love and self-discovery, one of which was ahead of its time. with the emphasis of pink and sterotypes in a unwelcoming space, this film opens up to being a campy atmospherical space in contrast to the plotline.
